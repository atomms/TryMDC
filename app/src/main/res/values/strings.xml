    <string name="largetext">Material Design is a system created to unify software design. Its guiding principles offer a means to its use, but its foundation is what makes the entire project possible. Material is the metaphor. Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows.[x] When we maneuver through the physical world, we do so with an innate recognition of our surroundings. Material Design is made to work in the same way. In other words, the physical world is governed by a set of rules and Material Design uses those rules to inform its design principles. It recreates the properties of our environment as the foundation for its own. This metaphor raises a question. If the rules that inform Material Design are the rules of the physical world, then what exactly are the rules of the physical world? How do we use them as keenly as we do? Where do they originate? Can we deliberately employ them? The real question I was after, can we apply the rules of the physical world to Material Design? Fortunately, these are the central questions of Immanuel Kantâ€™s Critique of Pure Reason. The famed philosopher wrote The First Critique (as it is called) in response to the tangled state of philosophy at the time. In it, Kant details the process of our experience and shows how it gives structure to the world around us. He used The First Critique to provide a new foundation for knowledge from which the questions of philosophy can rightly be answered. For this post, however, I will use his findings to reframe Material Design behind the principles it is based on; The principles behind our experience of the physical world.</string>
